Understanding Generative AI Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence techniques that enable machines to generate new content, predictions, or behaviors based on input data. Unlike traditional AI models that are deterministic, generative AI models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) can create new data instances that mimic the characteristics of the original dataset. In stock trading, generative AI is primarily used for: Predictive Modeling: Forecasting market trends, asset prices, and investor sentiment. Algorithmic Trading: Developing and optimizing trading strategies based on historical data and real-time market conditions. Risk Assessment: Identifying potential risks and vulnerabilities in investment portfolios.");
